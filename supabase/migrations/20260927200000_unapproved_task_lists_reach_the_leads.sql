-- ADR-0119 (Edward, 27 Sep) — I59.61. A task list waiting for approval reaches the department's leads,
-- and no campaign is exempt from the task-list gate any more.
--
-- Until now a task list waiting for approval was on its OWNER's Needs you only, and a campaign approved
-- before the gate (`task_list_gate_from`, ADR-0100 d.7) was left out of everything: no card, no
-- escalation, and its work could be assigned without the list ever being approved. On production that
-- was most of the 57 "task list not approved" tasks I59.59 found.
--
-- 1) `app.deliverable_work_acceptance_refusal`: the cut-over exemption removed, so older work waits for
--    its list like new work (d.1). Work already assigned is not touched.
-- 2) `app.leads_department` (new): is the caller the department lead of this department, or a team lead
--    (a team-scope role) of a team in it? Read off the role's reach, as `app.escalation_recipients` does.
-- 3) `app.task_list_waiting_since` (new): when a task list's clock starts. The campaign's approval, or,
--    for a campaign approved before the gate, this release (`task_list_backlog_from`, set below), so the
--    backlog gets a day on the cards before it escalates (d.3) rather than escalating all at once.
-- 4) `public.my_pending_approvals`: the task-list card goes to the owner AND the department's leads,
--    where they may approve it (d.2), for every campaign; `since` is (3).
-- 5) `app.escalation_due`: the task_list rung covers every campaign, timed by (3).
-- The three existing functions are re-emitted WHOLE from their live definitions; only the marked lines
-- changed.
